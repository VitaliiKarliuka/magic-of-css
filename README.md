## The Magic of CSS

> A CSS course for web developers who want to be magicians.

### What is this course?

CSS is [a mess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28Cascading_Style_Sheets%29). We all love it, but it's a mess. I liken it to English: there are a bunch of rules, and you can learn them. But sometimes your better off trying just trying shit and seeing what works and what doesn't. _Magic_ is a codification of what I've learned in that crazy process.

### How advanced are we talking?

This is an intermediate-to-advanced course. It assumes an understanding of the [CSS syntax](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp), [cascading and inheritence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Cascading_and_inheritance), commonly used [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors), and [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Color). That being said, there are no real prerequisites. If you want to learn CSS, show up.

### Weekly lectures

Each class will start with a brief lecture, covering a chapter or two from this online textbook. After that, we'll dive into studio where we'll build our magical CSS potions. Every lecture, _come prepared to make something_. So bring your laptop and thinking hat.
